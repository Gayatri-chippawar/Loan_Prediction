# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System (SVM)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a loan will be approved or not using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
The dataset is preprocessed, categorical values are encoded, and data visualization is performed using Seaborn (sns) to understand patterns and relationships.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (SVM)

Seaborn & Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Data Visualization

Count plots for categorical features

Distribution plots for numerical features

Relationship analysis using Seaborn

Visualization helps in understanding how features affect loan approval.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Model

Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Data preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical columns

Model trained and tested on loan dataset

## 🎯 Output

Predicts Loan Approved or Loan Not Approved

Simple rule-based output for user understanding

## 🚀 How to Run

Open the notebook in Jupyter

Run all cells sequentially

Enter input data for prediction

View prediction result

## 📚 Learning Outcome

Hands-on experience with SVM

Data preprocessing & encoding
